# Pathofact 1.0 vs Pathofact 2.0: Comparing Pipelines to Optimize Bacterial Virulence Prediction
## Clayton Meyer & Jailyn Loor 

Initally, we planned to compare both of the Pathofact 1.0 vs Pathofact 2.0 to each other.
However, we ran into extensive issues with software incompatibility making it difficult to run the pipeline.
Half-way through the semester we decided to pivot and focus on running DeepARG, a software used to predict antibiotic resistance genes.
