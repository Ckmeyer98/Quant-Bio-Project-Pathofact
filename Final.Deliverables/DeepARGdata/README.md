I uploaded one subset of DeepARG output onto github as it would be 
too big to upload the whole output folder. 

I uploaded an annotated version of understanding the
output labeled DeepARGoutputexample.PNG and this can be compared
to the output observed in SRR2005369_meta_assembly_deeparg_out.align.daa.tsv.
The annotations labeled in red refer to metaSPades output, while blue refers to DeepARG output.
